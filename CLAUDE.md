# vannmiljo-pilot

Quarto static website for the Vannmiljø Pilot Database
(https://seafood-hazards.github.io/vannmiljo-pilot/), deployed to GitHub Pages.
One of five per-source sites for the **pilot** generation of the
`multised-engine` pipeline (`../multised-engine`).

## The one dependency

`vannmiljo_pilot.sqlite`, downloaded from this repository's **latest** GitHub
release by the `download_resources.R` pre-render step and queried in the browser.
The site builds nothing from raw data and ships no other data file.

Two rules follow from that, and they are the ones that break the site when
missed:

- **every release must carry the database as an asset**, or the next render 404s
- **bump the `cacheKey` in `_db-setup.qmd` whenever the database content
  changes**, or returning browsers serve a stale cached copy

## Build

```r
renv::restore()   # restore R packages
```

```bash
quarto render     # renders the site to _site/
```

## Docs

| Doc | Covers |
|-----|--------|
| [database.md](docs/database.md) | the ten-table schema, how a page queries it, the cache key |
| [site.md](docs/site.md) | stack, build, page list, gitflow, the release procedure |

## Scope

Pilot generation, Vannmiljø only. The slim, clean, merged and refined
generations have their own sites: do not link to their pages, document their
schemas, or publish their database files here.
